## Types
- Classification
  - For categorical
- Regression
  - For numerical Data
## Supervised learning Algorithm
- Simple linear/Multiple regression
- Decision Tree Classification
- K-nearest neighbors (K-NN)
- Logistic regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- kernel SVM
- Naive Bayee
- Random Forest Classification
### Decision Tree Classification
- Decision Trees (DTs) are non-parametric supervised learning method used for classification and regression
- if then else decision rules\
props:
- a. Easy to use and interpret
- b. Little data preparation (non-parametric)
- c. Can be visualized
- d. Able to handle both numerical and categorical data.
- e. Multi-outpur problems can be handled
- f. Use boolean logic to model the predictions.
- g. Perform well(some of ther assumptions)\
Cons:
- Complex trees for beginners
- unstable
- No smooth or continuous predictions
- Complex steps (XOR, parity or multiplexer problelm)
- Decision tree learners create biased trees if some classes dominates
